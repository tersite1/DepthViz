## Features

### Accessibility
With the introduction of the LiDAR sensor in the iPhone 14 Pro, Apple has made this advanced technology more accessible to the general public. Previously, access to LiDAR sensors was limited, but now, everyday developers have the opportunity to process LiDAR data and explore its potential. This democratization of LiDAR technology opens up new possibilities for innovation and application development.

### Point Cloud Scanning
- **Advanced Scanning**: Use the LiDAR sensor to scan objects and environments, converting them into detailed point clouds.
- **High Accuracy**: Benefit from the high precision of LiDAR technology combined with camera and IMU data for accurate 3D modeling.


### File Management
- **Share**: Easily share scanned point cloud files with others.
- **Delete**: Manage your storage by deleting unnecessary files directly within the app.

### Future Enhancements
- **Integrated PLY File Viewer**: Planned updates include a built-in viewer for PLY files, allowing users to review their scans directly within the app without needing external software.

## Expected Benefits

DepthViz offers significant advantages, particularly in the construction industry:
