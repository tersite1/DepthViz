DepthViz is an iOS application designed to function as a point cloud scanner by integrating data from the LiDAR sensor, camera, and IMU sensor. This app is specifically tailored to operate on iPhone 14 Pro and newer models equipped with a LiDAR sensor, offering a robust tool for capturing and managing 3D data.

## Features

### Point Cloud Scanning
- **Advanced Scanning**: Use the LiDAR sensor to scan objects and environments, converting them into detailed point clouds.
- **High Accuracy**: Benefit from the high precision of LiDAR technology combined with camera and IMU data for accurate 3D modeling.


### File Management
- **Share**: Easily share scanned point cloud files with others.
- **Delete**: Manage your storage by deleting unnecessary files directly within the app.

### Future Enhancements
- **Integrated PLY File Viewer**: Planned updates include a built-in viewer for PLY files, allowing users to review their scans directly within the app without needing external software.

## Expected Benefits

DepthViz offers significant advantages, particularly in the construction industry:

### Client Monitoring
- **Remote Progress Tracking**: Clients can monitor the progress of their construction projects remotely, receiving updates without needing to visit the site physically.
  
### Site Inspection
- **Enhanced Inspection Capabilities**: Conduct thorough inspections of construction sites from anywhere, saving time and resources.
  
### Versatile Data Utilization
- **Wide Application Range**: The 3D point cloud data can be used in various scenarios, such as virtual tours, precise measurements, and enhanced planning, demonstrating its vast potential.

## Use Cases

- **Construction Management**: Supervisors and project managers can keep track of site developments and ensure compliance with project timelines and specifications.
- **Architectural Design**: Architects can create accurate models of existing structures and integrate them into their design process.
- **Surveying and Mapping**: Surveyors can quickly capture detailed terrain and structural information, improving the accuracy of their work.

## Technical Details

- **Languages**: Swift, Metal, C++
- **Compatibility**: Requires iPhone 14 Pro or newer models with a LiDAR sensor
